# Cluster-NBA-Players

We are going to implement the machine learning technique called clustering to visualize the types of point guards as well as group similar point guards together. We will use 2 features to accomplish this task because it allows us to easily visualize the players and will also make it easier to grasp how clustering works. 

For point guards, it's widely accepted that the Assist to Turnover Ratio is a good indicator for performance in games as it quantifies the number of scoring opportunities that player created. Let's also use Points Per Game, since effective Point Guards not only set up scoring opportunities but also take a lot of the shots themselves.
